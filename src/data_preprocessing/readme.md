## Data Preprocessing
Here, we prepare the functional networks and phosphorylation data utilized in [RoKAI demo](../../demo_rokai.m).
#### Loading known phosphosites and kinase-substrate annotations
We obtain a list of known phosphosites and known kinase-substrate annotations from [PhosphositePlus](https://www.phosphosite.org/staticDownloads). 
#### Preparing kinase-kinase interaction network

#### Preparing phosphosite level interaction network
